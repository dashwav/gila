# Very simple example showing how CLI flags work.

This will just demonstrate how one should interface a CLI argument parser with 
the gila library. The user is given the freedom to chose their own CLI flag parser
but for this example we use argparse.

### To Run:
```
python example.py --CC flag1,flag2 --L library1,library2
```
